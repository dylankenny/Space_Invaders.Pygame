# Space_Invaders.Pygame
Pygame Version of Space_Invaders

For a second year project we were asked to created a pygame version of
the popular game Space-Invaders. We were asked to use object oriented programming.
The one error within the file is that the bullets can kill two aliens at once.
I am currently trying to resolve this problem
